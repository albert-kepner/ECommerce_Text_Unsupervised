    "This project will use unsupervised methods to group textual product descriptions from E-commerce websites. The data are from this Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/ecommerce-text-classification . The data are all labeled with 4 classes: \"Electronics\", \"Household\", \"Books\" and \"Clothing & Accessories\". So the dataset is suitable for a supervised multiclass classification task. However we will apply unsupervised clustering methods to see how well we can group the text descriptions into the appropriate product categories. We will compare these results to supervised methods on the same data set.\n",

We used TfidfVectorizer to extract n-grams of length 1 or 2, and then used the 10,000 most frequently occurring n-grams across the corpus of all the product descriptions as features. The TFIDF weightings of each n-gram try to measure the importance of each term in each document with the goal of differentiating between topics in different documents. A few (about 6) of the documents were removed because they had no useful terms after the data cleaning step. This resulted in a TFIDF weighting matrix of 50419 documents by 10000 features, as a scipy sparse matrix."

We then used KMeans to cluster the documents using a reduced set of features from TruncatedSVD.

    "Model 4 uses a different approach to extract features from English text product descriptions. This time we used GloVe word embeddings.

The GloVe word embedding vectors are pre-trained on a large corpus of text, using the context in which words frequently appear to assign similar vectors to words with similar meanings. We used the 100 length vectors from this particular GloVe dataset: <b>Wikipedia 2014 + Gigaword 5 (6B tokens, 400K vocab, uncased, 50d, 100d, 200d, & 300d vectors, 822 MB download): glove.6B.zip</b>\n",

We then train a sequence based supervised classifcation model to recognize product categories, based on similar sequences of word meanings. Specifically we used an LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) neural network built with Keras for this model. For the LSTM model to work we need sequences of uniform length. Therefore we either pad or truncate all the sequences of word vectors to be the same length, in our case 150 word vectors. So the features of each document are a matrix of 150 words by 100 floats encoding each word."

    "We had better success with Model 2 by taking the high dimensional TF-IDF vectors (10,000 features) and using TruncatedSVD to reduce the dimensions before apply KMeans clustering. We attempted to tune this technique by considering a range of SVD components between 1 and 100 components, and picked the model which gave the most accurate clusters. The best clusters gave an accurcy of about 86% for 5 SVD components. Interestingly, the number of SVD components did not matter very much. Any of the values tried between 1 and 100 components produced an accuracy between about 79% and 86%. The variation in results appeared to be due to the randomness of the kmeans algorithm.\n",

It is not suprising that the supervised approaches were more accurate than unsupervised clustering, given that they used the additional information of the labeled training data."
