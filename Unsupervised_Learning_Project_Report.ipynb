    "This project will use unsupervised methods to group textual product descriptions from E-commerce websites. The data are from this Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/ecommerce-text-classification . The data are all labeled with 4 classes: \"Electronics\", \"Household\", \"Books\" and \"Clothing & Accessories\". So the dataset is suitable for a supervised multiclass classification task. However we will apply unsupervised clustering methods to see how well we can group the text descriptions into the appropriate product categories. We will compare these results to supervised methods on the same data set.\n",
